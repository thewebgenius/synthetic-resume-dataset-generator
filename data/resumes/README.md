# Resume Data

This directory will contain the generated JSON resume files.

To generate the dataset:
1. Run `python generate_resumes.py` to create 1000 JSON resume files
2. The generated files will appear in this directory with names like `resume_0001.json`, `resume_0002.json`, etc.

The generated files are excluded from git to keep the repository lightweight.
